# Rename Subtitles Script

**Still in progress!!!** testing logic, only works with strings for now (list of names).

**Comings soon...** Will work over folders and files

Ruby Script for renaming subtitles in a folder. It identifies the video files and the subtitle files and organize them in episodes, so each episode will have the same name for video and subtitle 

* Matches videos with extension [mkv, avi, mp4]
* Matches subtitles with extension [srt, sub]
